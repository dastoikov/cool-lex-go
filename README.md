## Examples

**LinkedList**

```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/dastoikov/cool-lex-go/coollex"
)

func main() {
	// no error for n=3, k=2
	generator, _ := coollex.NewLinkedList(3, 2)
	for combination := range generator.Combinations() {
		for element := range combination {
			fmt.Print(element)
		}
		fmt.Println()
	}
	// prints:
	// 01
	// 12
	// 02
}
```

**ComputerWord, 64-bit**

```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/dastoikov/cool-lex-go/coollex"
)

func main() {
	// no error for n=3, k=2
	generator, _ := coollex.NewComputerWord64(3, 2)
	for combination := range generator.Combinations() {
		for element := range combination {
			fmt.Print(element)
		}
		fmt.Println()
	}
	// prints:
	// 01
	// 12
	// 02
}
